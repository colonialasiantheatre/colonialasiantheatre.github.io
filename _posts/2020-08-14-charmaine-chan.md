### Introduction

Established by an Indian Muslim businessman, Bai Kassim, in 1902, the Bangsawan troupe Wayang Kassim performed in various parts of Malaya, Sumatra and Singapore. Mr Kassim also later in his life became the proprietor of Theatre Royal and it became the go-to destination for accommodating other visiting troupes. In colonial times, "the troupe [Wayang Kassim] performed different types of plays to attract ethnically diverse audience,"[^1] but the type of performances by the Wayang Kassim that takes precedence in this paper would be that of Shakespearean tragedies. It is a common perception for students of literature nowadays consider Shakespeare as something that is of absolute value and that needs to be approached and addressed with reverence. But the theatre troupe of Wayang Kassim overturned the modern perception of how Shakespeare is regarded and instead works of the highly regarded Bard were utilized with versatility to suit audiences overseas. Wayang Kassim's unorthodox methods at reproducing the classical plays of Shakespeare succeeds in giving new life to the plays and makes it a form of approachable entertainment to audiences that are not Europeans. This is also achieved by the incorporation of aspects of different regional cultures, such as Dutch actors, Malay costume and dialects that inspired the troupe during its travels. In this process, works of Shakespeare are used by the Wayang Kassim to feature local cultures of Malaysia, it is also in a way a testament to how theatre is a medium that reflects the dynamics of a community. In this paper, adaptations of Shakespeare's plays for the Malaysian stage by Wayang Kassim directors and playwrights will be examined for the value that it contributes to colonial Singapore's social environment as well as the influences on modern theatre in Singapore. I have referred to primary archival sources from Singaporean newspaper databases, especially news articles that feature the Wayang Kassim theatre troupe and their comical productions of Shakespearean plays presented as Bangsawan. This paper aims to demonstrate how the theatre troupe of Wayang Kassim interconnects different cultures through the reinvention of traditional plays and in so doing the proscenium theatre is internationalized as it extends beyond European countries that are familiar with the format to more regions that are able to inject cultural elements that are more familiar to them. In sum, Wayang Kassim's subversion of the traditional tragic plot makes Shakespeare's works amenable to other alterations that incorporate cultures of Southeast Asia (SEA) and therefore amalgamate cultures of the colonizer and the colonized.

### Wayang Kassim Productions of Shakespearean Plays

The troupe first performed in Singapore in 1904 with a production of *Othello.* Last performed in Singapore in 1909, staged various Shakespearean plays in Malay and many other Malay and Indonesian plays.[^2] The interest that this paper takes in the Wayang Kassim was initially brought on by the troupe's first production of Shakespeare's *Othello* in 1908. This review of the performance highlights the various comical elements that the troupe's playwright attached to the original play. This is quite an unconventional take on interpreting the revenge tragedy that is *Othello*. But as later research has shown, this is a very common approach when it comes to plays that are staged by Wayang Kassim. In an untitled Singaporean news article that featured*,* it mentions how Wayang Kassim, as a troupe, generally "has the happy faculty of turning tragedy into comedy, which seems to take immensely with its patrons, who were apparently, more than delighted with the *Malay interpretation* of Shakespeare's great play".[^3] The label of this play being a production of Shakespeare with Malay interpretations suggests that there various Malaysian culture that emerges from the midst of a Shakespearean play, it is almost as if the works of Shakespeare is further manipulated into a form of its own for the sake of being filled and incorporated with indigenous elements.

The incorporation of foreign cultural elements in the 1908 *Othello* was not a singular event of theatre providing a platform for amalgamating different cultures and attempt to represent the colonial social environment. In fact, "this departure from the original plot was a common feature of bangsawan Shakespeare."[^4] For example, in a 1904 production of Hamlet, the troupe dressed "the pensive Dane in Malay dress."[^5] It was not only Malaysian culture, Wayang Kassim also acknowledge the role Singapore plays as a multicultural hub in terms of the language that they would perform in, "[t]he popular songs and musical numbers of the Wayang Kassim were not only performed in Malay, but also in English, Singhalese and Tamil."[^6] In a production of The Merchant of Venice, a Dutch actor plays the character Shylock and while "[the actor] himself will speak his lines in his native language, but the rest of the company will interpret their parts in English,"[^7] various sources have indicated that the troupe's reproductions of the Bard's work "bore practically no resemblance to the play[s] known to Europeans, and yet Wayang Kassim's performances were immensely well received.

In colonial times, life was considered to be quite dull. In November 1896, *The Straits Times* even "lamented the lack of a general social club in Singapore for 'all the ordinary common or garden men among us'."[^8] This is a comment towards the lack of financially available entertainment for the common men, as means of entertainment such as opium smoking were only available to *towkay* (boss) and not to mention addictions were a quick way to loose one's job and accommodation. So many would turn to the outdoor theatre for entertainment both for leisure and for an escape of the over-crowded housing situations. Mr. Kassim's "Theatre Royal on North Bridge Road became a popular venue for daily evening performances of Shakespearean plays in Malay."[^9] This could partly be considered why playwrights of Wayang Kassim actively seek to inject comical elements to famous plays and why they ran with the conviction that it would be welcomed by the Malaysian public. It was not merely because as a Bangsawan performing group that they were to comply with the tone of informality that is expected from Malay Opera but also because the Wayang Kassim troupe "in their method of serving up Shakespeare, do much to brighten [Singapore's] otherwise dull existence."[^10]

### The Reflection of Globalization as Seen in Wayang Kassim Theatre

As previously mentioned, the performances put on by Wayang Kassim was highly inclusive of other cultures in their reproduction of Shakespeare. In fact, effort were made by founder of the troupe, Bai Kassim, to "employ several Dutch Eurasian and Sundanese actresses in 1903 who almost certainly had performed previously in Komedie Stamboel troupes"[^11] for the sake of the craft and the faithful representation of foreign cultures. This is not only to cater to the needs of diverse ethnicity in the audience as they are "as multicultural as the plays [that Wayang Kassim] performed, which consisted of Malays, Chinese, Indians and 'a good sprinkling of Europeans' who tried to escape the boredom of Singaporean nights."[^12] But it was also a way of representing the contemporary society. The art form that is the theatre is tied to the needs and interests of distinct social, ethnic groups that is within the performer's target audience. Wayang Kassim encapsulates with the medium of theatre, the international hub that was Singapore. Though the productions of Shakespearean plays were not faithful representations of the original work, they stood to represent a mix of culture in the contemporary society. Their success in doing so is testified by various primary sources which showed that Wayang Kassim was "popular with a very large section of the population ... And once, even the governor of Singapore graced a performance together with a visiting US admiral."[^13] As Malay theatre was influenced by the business role that Singapore played as an international hub among the British colony, the practice of theatre performance is also effectively a reflection of the global economy at the time.

### Conclusion

The significance in the research of how Wayang Kassim produced Shakespeare's plays is that it indicates an indigenous expression through theatre and what more is that there is proof suggesting that the practice of expressing of local culture persisted beyond theatre. Enthusiasts of the Bangsawan theatre persisted through the decline of the industry during WWII, various efforts were made to revive the performing art, which made onto showings through new mediums such as the television and videotapes.[^14] Wayang Kassim's practice in bangsawan utilizes known stories of Shakespeare and involves various indigenous culture, which pushes theatre towards an engagement with the contemporary society.
