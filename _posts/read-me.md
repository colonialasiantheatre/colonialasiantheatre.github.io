To make a new post, duplicate and rename this file. The file name should be

  YYYY-MM-DD-any-file-name-separated-by-hyphens.md

where YYYY, MM, and DD refer to numerical characters. Ideally, the date should be meaningful in a consistent way, e.g. date published, date submitted, and so on. You must add a date, or it won't show up on the website (to illustrate, this read me file does not have a date in the filename).

Atom (https://atom.io/) is a good general purpose editor for plaintext files like these.

The content of the post should go below the three hyphens ending the front matter---that is, the section of the file that lists the layout, title, author, and category of the post. So, you can replace all this text.

Remember to rename the title, author, and category. But do not change the layout. If you only need one category, remove the comma and the second category (including the second set of quotation marks)

If you want to add your post to the Student Works section of homepage, add change

  tag: ""

to
  tag: "preview"
