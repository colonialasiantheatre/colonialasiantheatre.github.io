  <p>My essay focuses on the 1940-50s theatre of colonial Hong Kong, and the messy discourse analysis that erupts from the unyielding archives of the <em>South China Morning Post</em> (SCMP). While I attempt to show that a framework of orient/other can become a cast set too soon when considering the role of theatre and the impact of ENSA, a military entertainment service, I find it fruitful to preface the discussion with a figure named Micheal Fong and his tenuous connection to H.J Mackinder. Kirsten Guest recalls to us the 1913 hearing for the passage of the National Theatre Act, which would subsidize a theatre in London to produce revered English plays such as those of Shakespeare. In it the house speaker at the time, she summarises, argues that at the “level of empire, a National Theatre would reinforce the sense of racial identity between colonies and their parent nations.”<a href="#ref1">[1]</a> House Speaker Mackinder continues: “If we wish to retain a language which shall be, when spoken, and not merely when written, then … you must have it heard as expressing its literature in some such central position.”<a href="#ref2">[2]</a> Of course, the act was not passed until 1949, two years after his death, but he might find some comfort in knowing that a mere 6 years after its passing, a citizen in the British colony of Hong Kong by the name of Michael Fong wrote this to the editor of the South China Morning Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sir—Sometime last month there was a recorded version of Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet” over Radio Hong Kong. I wonder whether it is possible for Radio Hong Kong to broadcast it once more as I missed it last time. Recorded versions of the great tragedies of Shakespeare—King Lear, Othello, Hamlet and Macbeth will be very much appreciated.<a href="#ref3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>English theatre’s role in colonial Hong Kong, then, can be understood as the import of English culture and language into the everyday of citizens. It’s role as a form of education can be seen in the Diocesan Girls School’s presentation of two plays in 1951,<a href="#ref4">[4]</a> as well as the Governor’s attendance of a University of Hong Kong (HKU) produced play ten years prior.<a href="#ref5">[5]</a> Plays were even written explicitly for the instruction of English to non-natives.<a href="#ref6">[6]</a></p>

<p><img src="/assets/shkim1.jpg" alt="" style="margin: 0 auto;" /></p>

<p>Figure 1. SCMP, 18 Jan 1956, 5.</p>

<p>But the role of theatre is not limited to the domain of education. Theatre, as a cultural highway between the colony and the mainland, serves not only to transport cultural commodities to the locals, but also to the military personnel stationed in Hong Kong. While interpreting theatre as a tool of orientalism while focusing on the discourse of power between the ‘local/mainland’ as well as its intersections with class in colonial Hong Kong is fruitful, it risks papering over the uneven development of English theatre in Hong Kong as well as attributing a false power to the British government. Said’s line of questioning: “Who writes? For whom is the writing being done? In what circumstances?”<a href="#ref7">[7]</a> is still relevant of course. But when he writes that “culture . . . is to be found operating within civil society, where the influence of ideas, of institutions, and of other persons works not through domination, but through what Gramsci calls consent,”<a href="#ref8">[8]</a> he prescribes a rigid frame of interpretation that does not adequately accommodate the shifty, vacillating nature of hegemony. Mackinder envisioned that Shakespeare was the right nail for pinning the English language to a high standard of shared culture and linguistic norm. But he did not predict that it would be utilized as a remedy for homesickness. Indeed, the first theatrical plays in Hong Kong were put on by homesick soldiers who started the Hong Kong Amateur Dramatic Club in 1844.<a href="#ref9">[9]</a></p>

<p>However, the focus of his essay will primarily be directed towards the 1940-50s, when the Entertainments National Service Association, or ENSA, was founded by two theatre directors, Basil Dean and Leslie Henson. Starting from January 1946, it ran for seventeen months before being superseded by the CSE (combined service entertainment). While it was running, they hosted theatre troupes from abroad as well as produced and starred servicemen from the British military. At the time, it was noted for its popularity with both “civilians and servicemen alike” and boasted a total of 94000 audience members over its lifetime.<a href="#ref10">[10]</a> As Becker observes, this is not an unusual or particularly noteworthy arrangement: “Most colonial Britons, whether soldiers, administrators, or businessmen, lived in close-knit diasporic communities.”<a href="#ref11">[11]</a> Theatre, as Becker argues, constituted a public space wherein diasporic Britons abroad could socialize and anchor themselves to the culture that they left behind at home. The continuation of a cultural history that extended back to Shakespeare helped to solidify the faraway colonial territory of Hong Kong as a legitimate participant of the empire. The intersection between education and entertainment is not tangential to the development of theatre in Hong Kong either. If the act of going to the theatre was a performance that indicated a level of civilization, then bringing it to Hong Kong could be thought of as a natural extension of the colonial project. The Said-ian idea of orientalism as an othering process by which the central orient gains in this unequal relationship, a “cultural contestant, and one of its [the occident]’s deepest and most recurring images of the Other.”<a href="#ref12">[12]</a> The difference between the colony and the mainland, as marked by their linguistic differences and lack of English theatre, as well as the sameness (Cantonese opera), produced a space in which both diaspora and nationalism were accommodated. For example, funds gathered from a Chinese theatrical play could be directed to the B.W.O.F war fund, and even legitimized by the presence of the governor in the audience.<a href="#ref13">[13]</a> On the other hand, Christmas could be celebrated by an eclectic performance of a hybrid musician who combined “modern” sounds with the traditional instruments of China. It is to be a medley, with theatre and classical music mixed in as well.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/shkim2.jpg" alt="" style="margin: 0 auto;" /></p>

<p>Figure 2. SCMP, 22 Dec 1946, 6.</p>

<p>This uneasy coexistence between both Chinese and English theatre highlights the key tension in the discussion of theatre in 1940-50s Hong Kong: borders. Theatre is delineated by physical borders that disconnect the public from the audience (via a dark, harshly lit room), audience from the stage (elevated wooden platforms and comfy chairs), the actor from each other (by bright spotlights) and even audiences from audiences (best seats in the house). This lends itself to an analysis of the power dynamics that are always interested in how certain groups are atomized and certain individuals, homogenized. As Michel Foucault writes: “the spatialising description of discursive realities gives on to the analysis of related effects of power.”<a href="#ref14">[14]</a> In other words, the tool of discourse analysis, language, biases us towards certain metaphorical understandings of power. The very same “instruments which will enable you to fight on that terrain” (Foucault, 1980, 65), also trap us in a language game. In a Lakoff-ian sense, “Argument is War” or in our case, “Space is Nation.” So, when touring companies come to Hong Kong<a href="#ref15">[15]</a> to entertain servicemen and Brits abroad, they are bringing with them a cultural capital to invest and territorialize a small building in the colony and transform it for a short moment into London. It also means that certain plays can be excluded as well. For example, German and Japanese plays were banned—a symbolic way of bordering off the colony from other hostile powers and their cultural reach.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/shkim3.jpg" alt="" style="margin: 0 auto;" /></p>

<p>Figure 3. SCMP, 3 Mar 1950, 9.</p>

<p>Equally as important as the import of plays into Hong Kong, are the borders that form once admittance is formalized. As advertisements state, any local that wants access must be accompanied by servicemen- as a plus one if you will.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/shkim4.webp" alt="" style="margin: 0 auto;" /></p>

<p>Figure 4. SCMP, 28 May 1946, 3.</p>

<p>This atomizes the colony of Hong Kong into two different sets of people, civilians and military servicemen, theatre goers and non-theatre goers, locals and expats. At the same time, it homogenizes by the same token, the military into one cohesive unit that has the exclusive right to protect, patrol and enforce these borders—a walking checkpoint of sorts into the culture of the United Kingdom. These borders were a permeable and flexible reality that kept changing and shifting to reflect the varying needs of the colony at the time. For example, at times, civilians were not allowed access at all due to a shortage of supply or an overflowing demand—at times civilians were allowed to book tickets without the permission of servicemen. In this regard, it is useful to turn to Raymond Williams framework of the hegemonic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lived hegemony is always a process. It is not, except analytically, a system or a structure. It is a realised complex of experiences, relationships and activities, with specific and changing pressures and limits.<a href="#ref16">[16]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than trying to understand the borderality of theatre as simple binaries that separate two disparate groups, utilizing the imagery of territory while still being open to sudden changes and resistance to the flow of power can allow a more fruitful understanding of theatre in colonial times. This is exemplified by Micheal Fong, the mystery man who wrote the editor’s note on SCMP. Bearing an almost stereotypically diasporic name, he enquires about the possibility of accessing through radio, an old English play that hints us towards an at least upper-middle class standing. The technology is there now to reach across oceans and scroll backwards in time- and yet we must still remain open to the possibility that our Micheal is a second-generation white man, or a well-educated local. While inconsequential to the larger discussion of theatre as a colonial project, the elusive figure of Micheal would have determined at least the tone of my essay. Archival studies on the past always work within the limitations of ambiguities and it is difficult to say for certain how or why theatre was produced in Hong Kong during the 1940-50s- but remaining open to the possibility of surprise and misinterpretation hopefully leads to a more honest discourse analysis of theatre during this time. Mr. Fong, I hope you got to enjoy your Shakespeare play.</p>
