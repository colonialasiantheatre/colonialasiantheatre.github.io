  <p>Colonial subjugation forced a multitude of ideological changes in the Indian subcontinent—not many as hotly contested as the rights of Hindu women. Debates surrounding these rights surfaced repeatedly and invited deeply polarized opinions. While the British supported the advancement of the female condition as a natural step in India’s path to progress, orthodox Hindus criticized it as an attack on their cultural and religious autonomy. Amid this contention, theatre became a popular attraction for the native population as both a recreational and political space—one where these debates could be dissected under the guise of entertainment. With women’s rights occupying an important role in political discourse at the time, theatre helped transplant women’s experiences from the privacy of their homes and broadcast them publicly. This essay explores how theatre in the nineteenth century subcontinent allowed safe passage for women’s experiences to proliferate public spaces<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> but argues that this visibility was undermined by mechanisms that divested them of control over these narratives. Hindu women’s relationship with the public sphere will first be contextualized, followed by a discussion on how theatre helped them access it. This will then be contested based on women’s inability to control the projection of their narratives, and to question the ones imposed onto them on stage. Tanika Sarkar’s book <em>Hindu Wife, Hindu Nation: Community, Religion, and Cultural Nationalism</em>, will be used to supplement the essay, in tandem with archival sources that document the workings of theatre in nineteenth century India.</p>

<p>Hindu women had a complicated relationship with public space, characterized largely by their devotion to chastity and domesticity. The traditional upper-caste Hindu woman was married as a child and expected to cohabit with her husband as soon as she attained puberty.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> If her husband died, she was either burnt on the pyre or was not allowed to remarry.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Following her marriage, she was placed into a life of seclusion that kept her away from all modes of institutional education.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> Restricted from the public in forced conjugality, women turned to a life of domesticity and the <em>zenana</em>—the private space within the home—became their domain<strong>.</strong> Hindu nationalists justified infant marriages by positing that, “… a lifetime of togetherness beginning with infancy guaranteed a superior … compatibility” and “… was also kinder to women since it ensured … a hold on the husband’s affection [and] an integration with the family.”<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> This compatibility was emphasized as a lifelong commitment, one that would continue even if the husband died. The <em>zenana</em>, on the other hand, was “not a dungeon as it was represented by some” but “a place of social union and purity” in the nationalist mind.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> Consequently, chastity and domesticity became underlying requirements for a society that framed infant marriages and restrictions on widow remarriage as a labour of love and excluded many Hindu women from the public space.</p>

<p>With the adoption of theatre into native circles, many Indian women were allowed newfound access to public sphere.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> They began appearing on stage as professional actors, a development initially championed in 1859 by writer Madhusudan Dutt of the Bengali theatre.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> In fact, actors of the time such as Binodini Dasi and Tara Sundari received much acclaim for their abilities, with Sundari paralleled to the likes of Sarah Bernhardt.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> While most of these women were originally sex workers, the stage also attracted “women abandoned by husbands or lovers, or widows” who were looking largely for employment. Moreover, women began appearing in theatre audiences when the Bengali theatre began attempts to reframe the art form as “family entertainment” by designating viewing spaces for women.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup> As a result, it not only became a source of economic empowerment, but seemed to provide a mediated public space where women of multiple backgrounds and hierarchies were able to shed the restrictions of a private life.</p>

<p>Arguably the most important development in theatrical tradition was the focus on domestic spheres. Women’s lives had largely been restricted to the <em>zenana</em> before theatre gave them a place to appear in public, and their narratives began to proliferate into public consciousness. At times, these narratives revolved around the injustices experienced by women, allowing potential for greater progressive discourse. For example, in 1873, Bengal’s first native pantomime shed some light on “the sorrows of the Hindu widow” in an impassioned speech, addressing the controversies regarding widow remarriage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How absurd … of the English to abolish widow burning, which at least afforded a speedy end to a life of misery, since they did not at the same time abolish the law against the remarriage of widows.<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although women were not given physical representation in the play (all actors were men, with women’s parts assigned to boys), it amplified Hindu women’s voices and shed light on their grievances. This visibility was further compounded in the performance reviews published in newspapers, extending the audience of the play to people who were not physically in attendance. Consequently, Western theatre seemed to offer more opportunities for empowerment to the Hindu woman by providing a public space where her narrative could be explored freely.</p>

<p>However, delving deeper into the role of theatre in women’s empowerment reveals impositions that weakened their visibility. It may be argued that in the realm of theatre, the actor is merely a vessel; she accepts the narratives imposed upon her by the audience, and the plot, without being able to project her own. Expounding upon the former, theatre in the nineteenth century was frequented largely by the predominantly male ruling class, who condemned public appearance as the ultimate transgression for Hindu women.<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup> They believed that these actors were “fallen women”<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> and anxiety prevailed that they posed a threat to the purity of young male actors,<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup> echoing the sentiments that used to dictate perceptions of <em>nautch</em> girls.<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup> With no way for them to contest this imposition, women’s access to public spaces continued to validate patriarchal associations between visibility and shame.</p>

<p>In addition to the audience, the drama itself eclipsed the actor’s personhood. Even though women were allowed to act, they possessed no control over what they portrayed on stage and so, their personal narratives remained outside of public view. At times, this resulted in women endorsing the same patriarchal views that kept them disenfranchised. Perhaps the best example of this stark incongruency would be a play staged by famous Marathi writer, Krushnaji Prabhakar Khadilkar in 1907, titled <em>A Women’s Revolt</em>. This play was “performed by a company composed so largely of women that “not only all the heroines but some of the heroes also were represented by members of the fairer sex,”<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup> reversing the longstanding tradition of boys performing the roles of women. At the outset, it seemed to be providing women with unprecedented visibility in the theatrical space. However, analyzing the plot reveals exactly the disparities that this essay attempts to delineate. Using Tennyson’s “Princess” as the basis of his drama, Khadilkar wrote a gripping epic on imperial India.<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup> The plot centers around an all-female kingdom that bars men from even stepping foot inside its boundaries. Its illusory independence falls apart when the Princess agrees to enter a “marriage of equality”<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup> with a man, restoring the family and domesticity as sacrosanct institutions for the women of the kingdom. The disintegration of this kingdom followed by the restoration of peace embodies an inherent conflict between women’s independence and conjugality. Early twentieth-century India was rife with debates on women’s remarriage, infant marriage and women’s education—all of which grappled with cultural and religious restrictions on female autonomy. With playwrights as influential as Khadilkar broadcasting their independence as a disruption in the natural order, women’s appearance on this stage ended up validating doctrines that supported restrictions on their visibility. As a result, these women became as helpless in subverting the dominant patriarchal narrative as those restricted to the <em>zenana</em>.<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup></p>

<p>Furthermore, there were times when theatre aimed a spotlight at the injustices that plagued women’s lives but framed them in ways that were inherently patriarchal. While such performances did not necessarily involve female actors, they seemed to bring women’s narratives into the open, but manipulated them to conform to public perceptions. For example, in 1873, the Guru of a wealthy Saivite temple was accused of seducing a young girl named Elokeshi and then raping her.<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup> Her husband initially forgave her for what he believed was her transgression, but when accosted by the Guru’s men, he slit Elokeshi’s throat in a fit of rage. Sarkar explains the theatrical adoption of this story:</p>

<p>Theatre at the time provided more publicity to this event than would have been given initially. Certainly, the largest corpus among nineteenth century farces related to a single contemporary event.<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup></p>

<p>At the outset, this visibility seems unprecedented, but it is to be noted that these performances were largely farces that did little to evoke public sympathy for Elokeshi. Many focused on the punishment and humiliation faced by the Guru, while some showed him as a repentant figure, decentring the narrative from Elokeshi’s death.<sup id="fnref:22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> In addition, unable to deny the facts of the rape and murder, some framed her stepmother as the culprit who forced her husband to sell Elokeshi to the Guru for material gain.<sup id="fnref:23" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup> Not only did this help reconcile the incident with “a more familiar … register of misogyny,” but also helped justify people’s fears of “a wife’s prolonged sojourn at her natal home.”<sup id="fnref:24" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup> As a result, an incident that reflected one of the gravest injustices perpetrated against women was manipulated to validate the stigma associated with her actions, or the actions of the women around her.</p>

<p>Historical accounts where women have been able to voice their own experiences dismantle the illusion that their commitment to chastity and domesticity was a labour of love, as Hindu nationalists would frame. In fact, their accounts painted an entirely different picture. One of the most celebrated actors of the time, Binodini Dasi, wrote an autobiography which she prefaced with a summary of her misfortune:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no one in this world before whom I can lay bare my pain, for the world sees me as a sinner—a fallen woman … I am a social outcast—a despicable prostitute. Why should people feel compassion for me?<sup id="fnref:25" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the orthodox Hindu perspectives, the misery she endured was justified given her previous profession, and her acclaim as an actor was secondary. Despite the visibility that theatre provided, her suffering echoes that of the women who spent their lives in seclusion. As Sarkar notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Women] wrote about the trauma … of infant marriage, the deprivations of the widow, the absence of love in the lives of wives … All varieties of women’s writings unanimously identified and condemned two problem spots within the Hindu woman’s existence—the pain of patrilocality and the longing for knowledge.<sup id="fnref:26" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The unanimity of the suffering expressed across multiple accounts penned by women in the nineteenth century confirms that the theatrical proliferation of their narratives was inauthentic, to say the least. At times, theatre ended up bolstering patriarchal impositions while rendering female actors’ complicit in these endorsements. As a result, the visibility it seemed to provide to women and their narratives became illusory.</p>

<p>Theatre in the nineteenth century subcontinent may have reconfigured women’s relationship with the public sphere, insofar as they were allowed to step out of the private domain. However, this loosening of physical constraints did not translate into an ideological emancipation; women were still judged within the same patriarchal frameworks that forced their seclusion. Most importantly, they could not subvert these ideas due to the limits placed on their agency by the theatre. In conclusion, theatre contributed to the exclusion of women’s narratives from public discourse by refusing them control over how they were viewed and could inadvertently have helped perpetuate the restrictions that women’s visibility could potentially have countered.</p>

      <p>It would be inaccurate to claim that women were not afforded any visibility before the import of Western theatre. In the nineteenth century, the nautch as a cultural form seemed to provide some women a similar window into the public domain where they were seen on stage, under the proverbial spotlight. However, the visibility it provided was not only restricted to a certain caste, but also came with its own patriarchal impositions. The nautch girls’ presence in public was framed as evidence of their misfortune, and associations between immorality and the nautch were solidified; it became a stage only for lower-caste women. Moreover, the nautch may have been as restricting as the zenana in women’s ability to control how people viewed them, as it existed purely for the male gaze and did not provide room for individual expression. <a href="#fnref:7" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
