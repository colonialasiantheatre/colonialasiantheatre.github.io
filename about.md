This website is a crowdsourced history of colonial South, Southeast, and East Asian theatre during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As part of the courses ‘Theatre and the World’ and ‘The Ghosting of Hong Kong Theatres’ at the University of Hong Kong, students conducted archival research and wrote historical essays on a topic of their choice. The case studies on this website indicate how  students developed their own scholarly arguments based on their research of primary sources.
